# Design Update Walkthrough

We have completely overhauled the website's UI to achieve a premium, modern, and "amazing" aesthetic. Here is a breakdown of the key changes:

## 1. Global Design System
- **Color Palette**: We introduced a rich "Deep Emerald" (`#047857`) as the primary color, accented with "Classic Gold" (`#d4af37`). This combination evokes trust, growth, and premium quality.
- **Typography**: We are now using **Outfit** for headings (modern, geometric) and **Inter** for body text (clean, readable).
- **Effects**: Added "Glassmorphism" (blur effects) to the header and overlays, along with subtle shadows and floating animations.

## 2. Header & Navigation
- **Sticky Glass Header**: The header now stays at the top as you scroll, transforming into a frosted glass bar.
- **Interactive Links**: Navigation links feature a smooth underline animation on hover.
- **Gradient Logo**: The logo now uses a subtle gradient text effect.

## 3. Hero Section (The "Wow" Factor)
- **Gradient Typography**: The headline "Every Great Business Is Built On Friendship" features a gradient highlight.
- **Animated Visuals**: Replaced the static placeholder with an animated, floating abstract composition using CSS shapes and gradients.
- **Background**: Added a subtle mesh gradient background to give depth to the page.

## 4. Interactive Elements
- **Brands Grid**: Brand cards now have a hover effect that lifts the card and reveals a "View Details" overlay.
- **Corporate Solutions**: Solution cards tilt and lift on hover, with icons that rotate and change color.
- **Values Ticker**: A smooth, continuous scrolling ticker displays the core values.

## 5. Footer
- **Premium Dark Mode**: The footer is now a deep slate color with a top gradient border, giving a solid foundation to the page.
- **Hover Effects**: Social icons and links glow and move slightly on interaction.

## How to View
Simply run the development server (`npm run dev`) and open the local host link. The changes are applied globally.
